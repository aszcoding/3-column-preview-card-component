## My process
I started coding this project in the desktop view first, which I completely forgot was backwards until I finished the project and started filling out this README file. I had some initial issues with getting the flexbox and the buttons to be responsive, but everything else was pretty straight forward. This was my first frontend mentor challenge, and I really enjoyed it! Looking forward to the next one! 

### Built with

- Basic CSS Reset (based on Andy Bell's modern reset)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

One of my main takeaways from this project is that in the desktop view, my buttons are fixed, but in the mobile view, my buttons are static. If I would have left my buttons as fixed in the mobile view, they'd overlap other content. 

### Continued development

An area I struggled most in is getting the buttons to be responsive. I found an article on w3 that was very helpful, which can be found here:

### Useful resources

- [Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me work through how to best use flexbox for this project.
